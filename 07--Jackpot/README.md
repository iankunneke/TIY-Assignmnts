## Jackpot

Create a single view application that shows a table view as its main interface to the user. Provide a Navigation Controller to handle eventual view transitions (we'll add these later) and also show a Navigation bar. Add an "add" button to the navigation bar that when tapped, will generate a quick pick lottery number and place it in a cell in the table view.

Quick pick is defined as a lottery number that is randomly generated. A lottery number is 6 integers that are within the range 1 through 53. Picking a number does not preclude it from being picked again for another of the 6 in the sequence.
