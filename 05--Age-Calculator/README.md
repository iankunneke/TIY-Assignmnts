## Age Calculator

Create an app with a main view that shows three labels: one for the birthdate of the user,  another to show the current date, and a final label to show the user's age. Provide a button to allow the user to set their birthdate. When this button is tapped, show a view controller with a date picker. Once this is shown and the user taps the back button, use a custom delegate to inform the main view of the chosen date (hint: see the Timer app and the OutaTime hw). With the birthdate displayed in the label (formatted nicely using an NSDateFormatter), provide a button on screen that allows the user to calculate their age. Perform the age calculation and then display the age in a label.
